# How to Run the Tests

This project uses `pnpm` as its package manager and Jest for running tests. Here's how you can run the tests for the pagination feature:

## Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js and pnpm**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have `pnpm`, you can install it by first installing Node.js, then running `npm install -g pnpm` in your terminal.
2.  **Project Setup**:
    *   Download or clone the project code to your computer.
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt.
    *   Navigate into the project's main directory (the one containing `package.json`).
3.  **Install Dependencies**: If you haven't done so already, you need to install the project's dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

## Running the Tests

Once the prerequisites are met and dependencies are installed, you can run the tests using the following command in your terminal (while in the project's root directory):

```bash
pnpm test
```

This command will execute all the automated tests in the project, including the ones for the pagination feature.

### What to Expect

*   The terminal will show output from the test runner (Jest).
*   It will indicate how many tests passed and if any failed.
*   If all tests pass, you'll typically see a message indicating success (e.g., "PASS" next to each test file or suite, and a summary of all tests passing).
*   If any tests fail, it will show which tests failed and provide details about the errors. This information is helpful for developers to fix the issues.

### Watching for Changes (for developers)

If you are actively developing and want the tests to re-run automatically whenever you save a file, you can use:

```bash
pnpm test:watch
```

This is generally more useful for developers during the coding process. For simply verifying that the tests pass, `pnpm test` is sufficient.
